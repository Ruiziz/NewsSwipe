3. Before you want to run this project, fill your own Amazon RDS endpoint and password in the 'ApplicationConfig' file under src/main/java package.
4. Right click on 'pom.xml' file and choose run as 'Maven Install'.
5. After you see 'Build Success' in console, right click the project folder and choose 'Run on Server'. (Make sure you have installed Tomcat Server on your IDE already, detailed [here](https://crunchify.com/step-by-step-guide-to-setup-and-install-apache-tomcat-server-in-eclipse-development-environment-ide/)).
